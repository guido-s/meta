Test for funnel plot asymmetry, based on rank correlation or linear
regression method.

\details{
Functions to conduct rank correlation or linear regression tests
for funnel plot asymmetry.

\subsection{Classic generic tests}{
The following tests are generic tests for funnel plot asymmetry
which only require estimates of the treatment effect and
corresponding standard errors. Accordingly, these are the only
tests provided by R function \code{metabias.default}.

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Begg"}, the test statistic
is based on the rank correlation between standardised treatment
estimates and variance estimates of estimated treatment effects;
Kendall's tau is used as correlation measure (Begg & Mazumdar,
1994). The test statistic follows a standard normal
distribution. By default (if \code{correct} is FALSE), no
continuity correction is utilised (Kendall & Gibbons, 1990).

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Egger"}, the test
statistic is based on a weighted linear regression of the treatment
effect on its standard error (Egger et al., 1997). The test
statistic follows a t distribution with \code{number of studies -
2} degrees of freedom.

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Thompson"}, the test
statistic is based on a weighted linear regression of the treatment
effect on its standard error using an additive between-study
variance component denoted as methods (3a) - (3d) in Thompson &
Sharp (1999). The test statistic follows a t distribution with
\code{number of studies - 2} degrees of freedom.  }

\subsection{Tests for meta-analysis with binary outcomes}{
The following tests for funnel plot asymmetry are only available
for meta-analyses comparing two binary outcomes, i.e. meta-analyses
generated with the \code{metabin} function. The only exception is
the test by Peters et al. (2006) which can also be used in a
meta-analysis of single proportions generated with \code{metaprop}.

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Harbord"}, the test
statistic is based on a weighted linear regression utilising
efficient score and score variance (Harbord et al., 2006,
2009). The test statistic follows a t distribution with
\code{number of studies - 2} degrees of freedom.

In order to calculate an arcsine test for funnel plot asymmetry
(Rücker et al., 2008), one has to use the \code{metabin} function
with argument \code{sm = "ASD"} as input to the \code{metabias}
command. The three arcsine tests described in Rücker et al. (2008)
can be calculated by setting \code{method.bias} to \code{"Begg"},
\code{"Egger"} and \code{"Thompson"}, respectively.

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Macaskill"}, the test
statistic is based on a weighted linear regression of the treatment
effect on the total sample size with weights reciprocal to the
variance of the average event probability (Macaskill et al., 2001,
\emph{method FPV}). The test statistic follows a t distribution
with \code{number of studies - 2} degrees of freedom.

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Peters"}, the test
statistic is based on a weighted linear regression of the treatment
effect on the inverse of the total sample size with weights
reciprocal to the variance of the average event probability (Peters
et al., 2006). The test statistic follows a t distribution with
\code{number of studies - 2} degrees of freedom. Note, this test is
a variant of Macaskill et al. (2001), \emph{method FPV}, using the
inverse sample size as covariate.

If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Schwarzer"}, the test
statistic is based on the rank correlation between a standardised
cell frequency and the inverse of the variance of the cell
frequency; Kendall's tau is used as correlation measure (Schwarzer
et al., 2007). The test statistic follows a standard normal
distribution. By default (if \code{correct} is FALSE), no
continuity correction is utilised (Kendall & Gibbons, 1990).

Finally, for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies, if
argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Deeks"}, the test statistic
is based on a weighted linear regression of the log diagnostic odds
ratio on the inverse of the squared effective sample size using the
effective sample size as weights (Deeks et al., 2005). The test
statistic follows a t distribution with \code{number of studies -
2} degrees of freedom.
}

\subsection{Test for the standardised mean difference}{
If argument \code{method.bias} is \code{"Pustejovsky"}, the test
statistic is based on a weighted linear regression of the treatment
effect on the square root of the sum of the inverse group sample
sizes using the treatment effect variance as weights (Pustejovsky &
Rodgers, 2019). The test statistic follows a t distribution with
\code{number of studies - 2} degrees of freedom.
}

\subsection{Recommendations and default settings}{
Following recommendations by Sterne et al. (2011), by default, a
test for funnel plot asymmetry is only conducted if the number of
studies is ten or larger (argument \code{k.min = 10}). This
behaviour can be changed by setting a smaller value for argument
\code{k.min}. Note, the minimum number of studies is three.

If argument \code{method.bias} is missing, the Harbord test
(\code{method.bias = "Harbord"}) is used in meta-analyses with a binary
outcome for the odds ratio and Deeks' test (\code{method.bias = "Deeks"})
for the diagnostic odds ratios. In all other settings, the Egger test
(\code{method.bias = "Egger"}) is used (Sterne et al., 2011).

No test for funnel plot asymmetry is conducted in meta-analyses
with subgroups.
}

If argument \code{plotit = TRUE}, a scatter plot is shown if
argument \code{method.bias} is equal to \code{"Begg"},
\code{"Egger"}, \code{"Thompson"}, \code{"Harbord"}, or
\code{"Deeks"}.

m3 <- update(m1, subset = 1:2)
metabias(m3)
