\description{
Meta-analysis on effects of elevated CO_2 on total biomass of woody
plants

This dataset has been used as an example in Hedges et al. (1999) to
describe methods for the meta-analysis of response ratios. The
complete dataset with 102 observations and 26 variables is
available online as a supplement. Here only a subset of 10
variables is provided and used in the examples.
