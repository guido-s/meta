\subsection{Estimation of between-study variance}{

The following methods are available in all meta-analysis functions
to estimate the between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2}.
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Method} \cr 
\code{method.tau = "REML"}
 \tab Restricted maximum-likelihood estimator (Viechtbauer, 2005) \cr
\tab (default) \cr
\code{method.tau = "PM"}
 \tab Paule-Mandel estimator (Paule and Mandel, 1982) \cr
\code{method.tau = "DL"}
 \tab DerSimonian-Laird estimator (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986) \cr
\code{method.tau = "ML"}
 \tab Maximum-likelihood estimator (Viechtbauer, 2005) \cr
\code{method.tau = "HS"}
 \tab Hunter-Schmidt estimator (Hunter and Schmidt, 2015) \cr
\code{method.tau = "SJ"}
 \tab Sidik-Jonkman estimator (Sidik and Jonkman, 2005) \cr
\code{method.tau = "HE"}
 \tab Hedges estimator (Hedges and Olkin, 1985) \cr
\code{method.tau = "EB"}
 \tab Empirical Bayes estimator (Morris, 1983)
}

For GLMMs, only the maximum-likelihood method is available.

Historically, the DerSimonian-Laird method was the de facto
standard to estimate the between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2} and is
the default in some software packages including Review Manager 5
(RevMan 5) and R package \bold{meta}, version 4 and below. However,
its role has been challenged and especially the REML and
Paule-Mandel estimators have been recommended (Veroniki et al.,
2016; Langan et al., 2019). Accordingly, the currenct default in R
package \bold{meta} is the REML estimator.

The following R command could be used to employ the Paule-Mandel
instead of the REML estimator in all meta-analyses of the current R
session:
\itemize{
\item \code{settings.meta(method.tau = "PM")}
}

Other estimators for \eqn{\tau^2} could be selected in a similar
way.

Note, for binary outcomes, two variants of the DerSimonian-Laird
estimator are available if the Mantel-Haenszel method is used for
pooling. If argument \code{Q.Cochrane = TRUE} (default), the
heterogeneity statistic Q is based on the Mantel-Haenszel instead
of the inverse variance estimator under the common effect
model. This is the estimator for \eqn{\tau^2} implemented in RevMan
5.
}


\subsection{Estimation of I-squared statistic}{

The following methods are available in all meta-analysis functions
to estimate the I-squared statistic (Higgins and Thompson, 2002).
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Method} \cr 
\code{method.I2 = "Q"}
 \tab Based on heterogeneity statistic Q (default) \cr
\code{method.I2 = "tau2"}
 \tab Based on between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2}
}

Using \code{method.I2 = "Q"} (Higgins and Thompson, 2002, section 3.3), the
value of I\eqn{^2} does not change if the estimate of \eqn{\tau^2} changes.
Furthermore, the value of I\eqn{^2} and the test of heterogeneity based on
the Q statistic are in agreement. R package \bold{metafor} uses the second
method (\code{method.I2 = "tau2"}) which is described in Higgins and Thompson
(2002), section 3.2. This method is more general in the way that the value
of I\eqn{^2} changes with the estimate of \eqn{\tau^2}.
}

\subsection{Confidence interval for common effect estimate}{

The following methods are available in all meta-analysis functions
to calculate a confidence interval for the common effect estimate.
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Method} \cr
\code{method.common.ci = "classic"} \tab Based on standard normal
  quantile \cr
\code{method.common.ci = "IVhet"} \tab Method by Doi et al. (2015) going
  back to Henmi and Copas (2010) \cr
}

The inverse variance heterogeneity method (IVhet) uses the weights under the
random effects model to calculate the confidence interval. This method is
only available if argument \code{method = "Inverse"}.
}

\subsection{Confidence interval for random effects estimate}{

The following methods are available in all meta-analysis functions
to calculate a confidence interval for the random effects estimate.
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Method} \cr
\code{method.random.ci = "classic"} \tab Based on standard normal
  quantile \cr
\tab (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986) (default) \cr
\code{method.random.ci = "HK"} \tab Method by Hartung and Knapp
  (2001a/b) \cr
\code{method.random.ci = "KR"} \tab Kenward-Roger method (Partlett and
  Riley, 2017)
}

DerSimonian and Laird (1986) introduced the classic random effects
model using a quantile of the standard normal distribution to
calculate a confidence interval for the random effects
estimate. This method implicitly assumes that the weights in the
random effects meta-analysis are not estimated but
given. Particularly, the uncertainty in the estimation of the
between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2} is ignored.

Hartung and Knapp (2001a,b) proposed an alternative method for
random effects meta-analysis based on a refined variance estimator
for the treatment estimate and a quantile of a
\emph{t}-distribution with \emph{k-1} degrees of freedom where
\emph{k} corresponds to the number of studies in the
meta-analysis.

The Kenward-Roger method is only available for the REML estimator
(\code{method.tau = "REML"}) of the between-study variance
\eqn{\tau^2} (Partlett and Riley, 2017). This method is based on an
adjusted variance estimate for the random effects
estimate. Furthermore, a quantile of a \emph{t}-distribution with
adequately modified degrees of freedom is used to calculate the
confidence interval.

For GLMMs and three-level models, the Kenward-Roger method is not
available, but a method similar to Knapp and Hartung (2003) is used
if \code{method.random.ci = "HK"}. For this method, the variance
estimator is not modified, however, a quantile of a
\emph{t}-distribution with \emph{k-1} degrees of freedom is used;
see description of argument \code{test} in
\code{\link[metafor]{rma.glmm}} and \code{\link[metafor]{rma.mv}}.

Simulation studies (Hartung and Knapp, 2001a,b; IntHout et al.,
2014; Langan et al., 2019) show improved coverage probabilities of
the Hartung-Knapp method compared to the classic random effects
method. However, in rare settings with very homogeneous treatment
estimates, the Hartung-Knapp variance estimate can be arbitrarily
small resulting in a very narrow confidence interval (Knapp and
Hartung, 2003; Wiksten et al., 2016). In such cases, an \emph{ad
hoc} variance correction has been proposed by utilising the
variance estimate from the classic random effects model with the
Hartung-Knapp method (Knapp and Hartung, 2003; IQWiQ, 2022). An
alternative \emph{ad hoc} approach is to use the confidence
interval of the classic common or random effects meta-analysis if
it is wider than the interval from the Hartung-Knapp method
(Wiksten et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2017).

Argument \code{adhoc.hakn.ci} can be used to choose the \emph{ad
hoc} correction for the Hartung-Knapp (HK) method:
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{\emph{Ad hoc} method} \cr
\code{adhoc.hakn.ci = ""} \tab no \emph{ad hoc} correction (default)
  \cr
\code{adhoc.hakn.ci = "se"} \tab use variance correction if HK standard
 error is smaller \cr
 \tab than standard error from classic random effects
 \cr
 \tab meta-analysis (Knapp and Hartung, 2003) \cr
\code{adhoc.hakn.ci = "IQWiG6"} \tab use variance correction if HK
 confidence interval \cr
 \tab is narrower than CI from classic random effects model \cr
 \tab with DerSimonian-Laird estimator (IQWiG, 2022) \cr
\code{adhoc.hakn.ci = "ci"} \tab use wider confidence interval of
 classic random effects \cr
 \tab and HK meta-analysis \cr
 \tab (Hybrid method 2 in Jackson et al., 2017)
}

For GLMMs and three-level models, the \emph{ad hoc} variance
corrections are not available.
}

\subsection{Prediction interval}{

The following methods are available in all meta-analysis functions
to calculate a prediction interval for the treatment effect in a
single new study.
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Method} \cr
\code{method.predict = "V"} \tab Based on \emph{t}-distribution
  with \emph{k-1} degrees of freedom \cr
  \tab (Veroniki et al., 2019) (default) \cr
\code{method.predict = "HTS"} \tab Based on \emph{t}-distribution
  with \emph{k-2} degrees of freedom \cr
  \tab (Higgins et al., 2009) \cr
\code{method.predict = "HK"} \tab Based on Hartung-Knapp standard error
  and \cr
  \tab \emph{t}-distribution with \emph{k-1} degrees of freedom \cr
\code{method.predict = "HK-PR"} \tab Based on Hartung-Knapp standard error
  and \cr
  \tab \emph{t}-distribution with \emph{k-2} degrees of freedom \cr
  \tab (Partlett and Riley, 2017) \cr
\code{method.predict = "KR"} \tab Based on Kenward-Roger standard error
  and \cr
  \tab \emph{t}-distribution with approximate Kenward-Roger \cr
  \tab degrees of freedom \cr
\code{method.predict = "KR-PR"} \tab Based on Kenward-Roger standard error
  and \cr
  \tab \emph{t}-distribution with approximate Kenward-Roger \cr
  \tab degrees of freedom minus 1 (Partlett and Riley, 2017) \cr
\code{method.predict = "NNF"} \tab Bootstrap approach (Nagashima et
  al., 2019) \cr
\code{method.predict = "S"} \tab Based on standard normal quantile
  (Skipka, 2006)
}

By default (\code{method.predict = "V"}), the prediction interval
is based on a \emph{t}-distribution with \emph{k-1} degrees of
freedom where \emph{k} corresponds to the number of studies in the
meta-analysis (Veroniki et al., 2019). The method by Higgins et al., (2009),
which is based on a \emph{t}-distribution with \emph{k-2} degrees of freedom,
has been the default in R package \bold{meta}, version 7.0-0 or lower.

The Hartung-Knapp prediction intervals are also based on a
\emph{t}-distribution, however, use a different standard error.

The Kenward-Roger method is only available for the REML estimator
(\code{method.tau = "REML"}) of the between-study variance
\eqn{\tau^2} (Partlett and Riley, 2017). This method is based on an
adjusted variance estimate for the random effects
estimate. Furthermore, a quantile of a \emph{t}-distribution with
adequately modified degrees of freedom is used to calculate the prediction
interval.

The bootstrap approach is only available if R package \bold{pimeta}
is installed (Nagashima et al., 2019). Internally, the
\code{\link[pimeta]{pima}} function is called with argument
\code{method = "boot"}. Argument \code{seed.predict} can be used to
get a reproducible bootstrap prediction interval and argument
\code{seed.predict.subgroup} for reproducible bootstrap prediction
intervals in subgroups.

The method of Skipka (2006) ignores the uncertainty in the
estimation of the between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2} and thus has
too narrow limits for meta-analyses with a small number of studies.

For GLMMs and three-level models, only the methods by Veroniki et al.
(2019), Higgins et al. (2009) and Skipka (2006) are available. Argument
\code{method.predict = "V"} in R package \bold{meta} gives the same
prediction intervals as R functions \code{\link[metafor]{rma.glmm}} or
\code{\link[metafor]{rma.mv}} with argument \code{test = "t"}.

Note, in R package \bold{meta}, version 7.0-0 or lower, the methods
\code{method.predict = "HK-PR"} and \code{method.predict = "KR-PR"} have
been available as \code{method.predict = "HK"} and
\code{method.predict = "KR"}.

Argument \code{adhoc.hakn.pi} can be used to choose the \emph{ad
hoc} correction for the Hartung-Knapp method:

\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{\emph{Ad hoc} method} \cr
\code{adhoc.hakn.pi = ""} \tab no \emph{ad hoc} correction (default)
  \cr
\code{adhoc.hakn.pi = "se"} \tab use variance correction if HK
 standard error is smaller
}
}

\subsection{Confidence interval for the between-study variance}{

The following methods are available in all meta-analysis functions
to calculate a confidence interval for \eqn{\tau^2} and \eqn{\tau}.
\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Argument} \tab \bold{Method} \cr 
\code{method.tau.ci = "J"} \tab Method by Jackson (2013) \cr
\code{method.tau.ci = "BJ"} \tab Method by Biggerstaff and Jackson (2008) \cr
\code{method.tau.ci = "QP"} \tab Q-Profile method (Viechtbauer, 2007) \cr
\code{method.tau.ci = "PL"} \tab Profile-Likelihood method for three-level \cr
 \tab meta-analysis model (Van den Noortgate et al., 2013) \cr
\code{method.tau.ci = ""} \tab No confidence interval
}
The first three methods have been recommended by Veroniki et
al. (2016). By default, the Jackson method is used for the
DerSimonian-Laird estimator of \eqn{\tau^2} and the Q-profile
method for all other estimators of \eqn{\tau^2}.

The Profile-Likelihood method is the only method available for the
three-level meta-analysis model.

For GLMMs, no confidence intervals for \eqn{\tau^2} and \eqn{\tau}
are calculated.
}

\subsection{Change default settings for R session}{

R function \code{\link{settings.meta}} can be used to change the
previously described and several other default settings for the
current R session.

Some pre-defined general settings are available:
\itemize{
\item \code{settings.meta("RevMan5")}
\item \code{settings.meta("JAMA")}
\item \code{settings.meta("BMJ")}
\item \code{settings.meta("IQWiG5")}
\item \code{settings.meta("IQWiG6")}
\item \code{settings.meta("geneexpr")}
}

The first command can be used to reproduce meta-analyses from
Cochrane reviews conducted with \emph{Review Manager 5} (RevMan 5)
and specifies to use a RevMan 5 layout in forest plots.

The second command can be used to generate forest plots following
instructions for authors of the \emph{Journal of the American
Medical Association}. Study labels according to JAMA guidelines can be
generated using \code{\link{labels.meta}}.

The third command can be used to generate forest plots in the current layout
of the \emph{British Medical Journal}.

The next two commands implement the recommendations of the
Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG),
Germany accordinging to General Methods 5 and 6, respectively
(\url{https://www.iqwig.de/en/about-us/methods/methods-paper/}).

The last setting can be used to print p-values in scientific
notation and to suppress the calculation of confidence intervals
for the between-study variance.

See \code{\link{settings.meta}} for more details on these
pre-defined general settings.

In addition, \code{\link{settings.meta}} can be used to define
individual settings for the current R session. For example, the
following R command specifies the use of Hartung-Knapp and
Paule-Mandel method, and the printing of prediction intervals for
any meta-analysis generated after execution of this command:
\itemize{
\item \code{settings.meta(method.random.ci = "HK", method.tau =
  "PM", prediction = TRUE)}
}
}

\subsection{Data sets}{
The following data sets are available in R package \bold{meta}.

\tabular{ll}{
\bold{Data set} \tab \bold{Description} \cr
\code{\link{Fleiss1993bin}} \tab Aspirin after myocardial infarction \cr
\code{\link{Fleiss1993cont}} \tab Mental health treatment on medical utilisation\cr
