\description{
Calculation of common and random effects estimates for meta-analyses
with continuous outcome data; inverse variance weighting is used
for pooling.
}
\details{
Calculation of common and random effects estimates for meta-analyses
with continuous outcome data; inverse variance weighting is used
for pooling.

A three-level random effects meta-analysis model (Van den Noortgate
et al., 2013) is utilised if argument \code{cluster} is used and at
least one cluster provides more than one estimate. Internally,
\code{\link[metafor]{rma.mv}} is called to conduct the analysis and
\code{\link[metafor]{weights.rma.mv}} with argument \code{type =
"rowsum"} is used to calculate random effects weights.

Default settings are utilised for several arguments (assignments
using \code{\link{gs}} function). These defaults can be changed for
the current R session using the \code{\link{settings.meta}}
function.

Furthermore, R function \code{\link{update.meta}} can be used to
rerun a meta-analysis with different settings.

Three different types of summary measures are available for continuous
outcomes:
\itemize{
\item mean difference (argument \code{sm = "MD"})
\item standardised mean difference (\code{sm = "SMD"})
\item ratio of means (\code{sm = "ROM"})
}

\subsection{Standardised mean difference}{

For the standardised mean difference three methods are implemented:
\itemize{
\item Hedges' g (default, \code{method.smd = "Hedges"}) - see
  Hedges (1981)
\item Cohen's d (\code{method.smd = "Cohen"}) - see Cohen (1988)
\item Glass' delta (\code{method.smd = "Glass"}) - see Glass (1976)
}

Hedges (1981) calculated the exact bias in Cohen's d which is a
ratio of gamma distributions with the degrees of freedom,
i.e. total sample size minus two, as argument. By default (argument
\code{exact.smd = FALSE}), an accurate approximation of this bias
provided in Hedges (1981) is utilised for Hedges' g as well as its
standard error; these approximations are also used in RevMan
5. Following Borenstein et al. (2009) these approximations are not
used in the estimation of Cohen's d. White and Thomas (2005) argued
that approximations are unnecessary with modern software and
accordingly promote to use the exact formulae; this is possible
using argument \code{exact.smd = TRUE}. For Hedges' g the exact
formulae are used to calculate the standardised mean difference as
well as the standard error; for Cohen's d the exact formula is only
used to calculate the standard error. In typical applications (with
sample sizes above 10), the differences between using the exact
formulae and the approximation will be minimal.

For Glass' delta, by default (argument \code{sd.glass =
"control"}), the standard deviation in the control group
(\code{sd.c}) is used in the denominator of the standard mean
difference. The standard deviation in the experimental group
(\code{sd.e}) can be used by specifying \code{sd.glass =
"experimental"}.
}

\subsection{Ratio of means}{

Meta-analysis of ratio of means -- also called response ratios --
is described in Hedges et al. (1999) and Friedrich et al. (2008).
Calculations are conducted on the log scale and list elements
\code{TE}, \code{TE.common}, and \code{TE.random} contain the
logarithm of the ratio of means. In printouts and plots these
values are back transformed if argument \code{backtransf = TRUE}.
}

\subsection{Approximate means from sample sizes, medians and other statistics}{

Missing means in the experimental group (analogously for the
control group) can be derived from
\enumerate{
\item sample size, median, interquartile range and range (arguments
  \code{n.e}, \code{median.e}, \code{q1.e}, \code{q3.e},
  \code{min.e}, and \code{max.e}),
\item sample size, median and interquartile range (arguments
  \code{n.e}, \code{median.e}, \code{q1.e}, and \code{q3.e}), or
\item sample size, median and range (arguments \code{n.e},
  \code{median.e}, \code{min.e}, and \code{max.e}).
}

By default, methods described in Luo et al. (2018) are utilised
(argument \code{method.mean = "Luo"}):
\itemize{
\item equation (15) if sample size, median, interquartile range and 
  range are available,
\item equation (11) if sample size, median and interquartile range
  are available,
\item equation (7) if sample size, median and range are available.
}

Instead the methods described in Wan et al. (2014) are used if
argument \code{method.mean = "Wan"}:
\itemize{
\item equation (10) if sample size, median, interquartile range and 
  range are available,
\item equation (14) if sample size, median and interquartile range
  are available,
\item equation (2) if sample size, median and range are available.
}

The following methods are also available to estimate means from
quantiles or ranges if R package \bold{estmeansd} is installed:
\itemize{
\item Method for Unknown Non-Normal Distributions (MLN) approach
  (Cai et al. (2021), argument \code{method.mean = "Cai"}),
\item Quantile Estimation (QE) method (McGrath et al. (2020),
  argument \code{method.mean = "QE-McGrath"})),
\item Box-Cox (BC) method (McGrath et al. (2020),
  argument \code{method.mean = "BC-McGrath"})).
}

By default, missing means are replaced successively using
interquartile ranges and ranges (if available), interquartile
ranges (if available) and finally ranges. Arguments
\code{approx.mean.e} and \code{approx.mean.c} can be used to
overwrite this behaviour for each individual study and treatment
arm:
\itemize{
\item use means directly (entry \code{""} in argument
  \code{approx.mean.e} or \code{approx.mean.c});
\item median, interquartile range and range (\code{"iqr.range"});
\item median and interquartile range (\code{"iqr"});
\item median and range (\code{"range"}).
}
}

\subsection{Approximate standard deviations from sample sizes,
medians and other statistics}{

Missing standard deviations in the experimental group (analogously
for the control group) can be derived from
\enumerate{
\item sample size, median, interquartile range and range (arguments
  \code{n.e}, \code{median.e}, \code{q1.e}, \code{q3.e},
  \code{min.e}, and \code{max.e}),
\item sample size, median and interquartile range (arguments
  \code{n.e}, \code{median.e}, \code{q1.e} and \code{q3.e}), or
\item sample size, median and range (arguments \code{n.e},
  \code{median.e}, \code{min.e} and \code{max.e}).
}

Wan et al. (2014) describe methods to estimate the standard
deviation from the sample size, median and additional
statistics. Shi et al. (2020) provide an improved estimate of the
standard deviation if the interquartile range and range are
available in addition to the sample size and median. Accordingly,
equation (11) in Shi et al. (2020) is the default (argument
\code{method.sd = "Shi"}), if the median, interquartile range and
range are provided. The method by Wan et al. (2014) is used if
argument \code{method.sd = "Wan"} and, depending on the sample
size, either equation (12) or (13) is used. If only the
interquartile range or range is available, equations (15) / (16)
and (7) / (9) in Wan et al. (2014) are used, respectively.

The following methods are also available to estimate standard
deviations from quantiles or ranges if R package \bold{estmeansd}
is installed:
\itemize{
\item Method for Unknown Non-Normal Distributions (MLN) approach
  (Cai et al. (2021), argument \code{method.mean = "Cai"}),
\item Quantile Estimation (QE) method (McGrath et al. (2020),
  argument \code{method.mean = "QE-McGrath"})),
\item Box-Cox (BC) method (McGrath et al. (2020),
  argument \code{method.mean = "BC-McGrath"})).
}

By default, missing standard deviations are replaced successively
using these method, i.e., interquartile ranges and ranges are used
before interquartile ranges before ranges. Arguments
\code{approx.sd.e} and \code{approx.sd.c} can be used to overwrite
this default for each individual study and treatment arms:
\itemize{
\item sample size, median, interquartile range and range
  (\code{"iqr.range"});
\item sample size, median and interquartile range (\code{"iqr"});
\item sample size, median and range (\code{"range"}).
}
}

\subsection{Confidence intervals for individual studies}{

For the mean difference (argument \code{sm = "MD"}), the confidence
interval for individual studies can be based on the
\itemize{
\item standard normal distribution (\code{method.ci = "z"}, default), or
\item t-distribution (\code{method.ci = "t"}).
}

Note, this choice does not affect the results of the common effect
and random effects meta-analysis.
}

\subsection{Subgroup analysis}{

Argument \code{subgroup} can be used to conduct subgroup analysis for
a categorical covariate. The \code{\link{metareg}} function can be
used instead for more than one categorical covariate or continuous
covariates.
}

\subsection{Exclusion of studies from meta-analysis}{

Arguments \code{subset} and \code{exclude} can be used to exclude
studies from the meta-analysis. Studies are removed completely from
the meta-analysis using argument \code{subset}, while excluded
studies are shown in printouts and forest plots using argument
\code{exclude} (see Examples in \code{\link{metagen}}).
Meta-analysis results are the same for both arguments.
}

\subsection{Presentation of meta-analysis results}{

Internally, both common effect and random effects models are
calculated regardless of values choosen for arguments \code{common}
and \code{random}. Accordingly, the estimate for the random effects
model can be extracted from component \code{TE.random} of an object
of class \code{"meta"} even if argument \code{random =
FALSE}. However, all functions in R package \bold{meta} will
adequately consider the values for \code{common} and
\code{random}. E.g. function \code{\link{print.meta}} will not
print results for the random effects model if \code{random =
FALSE}.

A prediction interval will only be shown if \code{prediction =
TRUE}.
}
}
\note{
The function \code{\link{metagen}} is called internally to
calculate individual and overall treatment estimates and standard
errors.
